Install via ng add. (Recommended)\nIf Angular Material Design is not setup, just run ng add @angular/material learn more\nNow add the library via the angular schematics\nshell\nng add @angular-material-extensions/password-strength\n2. Install via npm. (Alternative)\nNow install @angular-material-extensions/password-strength via:\nshell\nnpm install --save @angular-material-extensions/password-strength\n\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for @angular-material-extensions/password-strength:\njs\nmap: {\n  '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength': 'node_modules/@angular-material-extensions/password-strength/bundles/password-strength.umd.js',\n}\n\n-> follow the instructions here \n\nImport the library\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\njs\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\nThe only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatPasswordStrengthModule .forRoot()):\n```js\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatPasswordStrengthModule.forRoot(), ...],  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nOther modules in your application can simply import MatPasswordStrengthModule:\n```js\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatPasswordStrengthModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n```\n\n\nAPI\n used to calculate and display the strength of a provided password - see the demo examples\n| option | bind  |  type  |   default    | description  |\n|:-------------------|:--------:|:------:|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| password           | Input()  | string    | -

see below\n\n\n```html\n\n  \n    Password\n    \n    \n      {{passwordWithValidation.value.length}} / 25\n    \n    \n      Password is required\n    \n    \n      Password is not valid\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n```\n\nthis will looks like -->\n\n  \n\n\n\ncustom regex validation\nplease consider to use the customValidator input (see below)\n```html\nShow Password Details\n \n  Password\n  \n  \n  \n    {{password.value.length}} / {{passwordComponent.max}}\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n```\nts\npattern = new RegExp(/^(?=.*?[äöüÄÖÜß])/);\nConfirm the password with built in angular form controllers - see the live example\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUse always the green color for a strong password just by adding the green css class to the mat-password-strength\nhtml\n\n\nSupporting custom messages and ngx-translate for the info component please check the example demo here\n\n  \n\n\nfor more examples please visit this URL : (https://angular-material-extensions.github.io/password-strength/examples\nPlease checkout the full documentation here \nor follow the official tutorial\n\n\n\n Run Demo App Locally\n\n\nDevelopment\nOther Angular Libraries\n\nngx-auth-firebaseui\nngx-linkifyjs\n@firebaseui/ng-bootstrap\n@angular-material-extensions/link-preview\n@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete\n@angular-material-extensions/pages\n@angular-material-extensions/contacts\n@angular-material-extensions/faq\n@angular-material-extensions/combination-generator\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nDrop an email to: Anthony Nahas\n\nor open an appropriate issue\n\nlet us chat on Gitter\nBuilt by and for developers :heart: we will help you :punch:\n\n\n\n\nThis project is supported by jetbrains with 1 ALL PRODUCTS PACK OS LICENSE incl. webstorm\n\n\n\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2019 Anthony Nahas.
